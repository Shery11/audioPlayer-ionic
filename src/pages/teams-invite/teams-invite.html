    <h3>How does this work?</h3>
    <p>An invitation email is sent to the user or users you entered. Once they accept your invitation and create an account, you’ll see them in your dashboard as active.</p>
    <h3>What happens if they don’t receive the email</h3>
    <p>First you should check that the user was added correctly to your group, if you entered the wrong email address, you can simply delete the user added and re-invite them following the same proccess.</p>
    <p>If the email has been entered correctly, simply visit thier detail page and hit the re-send invite button. Make sure you tell the member of your group to check the spam box as this may be the case why they can’t see the invite.</p>
